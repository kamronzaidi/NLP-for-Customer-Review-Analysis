This Comfort Inn is a step up from what you would normally expect from the usual Comfort Inn standards..  We were impressed from the very beginning.   The check in was quick and informative, the staff were very courteous and friendly, the selected room was super clean, the room smelled fresh and the King Size bed....well it would just have to wait.

We are from the Maritimes and our salt water pool would be a quick dip into the Northumberland Straight....we travel quite a bit but this was our first Salt Water Pool.  Everything about this Comfort Inn was impressive....we were so happy that we had made the decision to over night in Cornwall.\n\n       We then decided to take a drive and to check out where we might have our evening dinner.  We found a delightful restaurant that specialized in Steak, Chicken & Ribs and provided homemade pastries.  Bruyere's on Brookdale, Avenue is a name that you should remember and it is not far from the Comfort Inn.  We had a wonderful meal.  I would highly recommend  this particular restaurant and I plan on doing a review shortly.  \n\n       We were about to leave the restaurant and the sky opened  up and it rained very hard.  We arrived at the hotel and in our room a little bit wet to say the least.  We were cold and wet...so the first thing was to turn up the heat to try and dry out and to warm up.  However, the electrical heater in our room did not function.  I notified the reception desk and immediately the staff on duty saw our dilemma and provided us with another room.  What a  surprise....we were upgraded to a  Corporate Suite.

As soon as we went into the actual hotel area it was a entirely different world. Before you decide to settle here ask to walk into the hallway behind the glass door that separated the front desk from the smell of death, cigarettes, and mold. We put our stuff in the room and opened all the windows and propped the door open with the air on high just to be able to stand being in there until we decided what to do. We decided to just grin and bear it and let the kids try the pool. We got dressed fast and went down and as we walked through the halls my husband and I were disgusted. I am ok with outdated but this place was down right dirty. The wall paper couldn't even stick to the walls it was so dirty. If you go there check out the row of cut outs in the hall to the pool. They should be decorative but all they are displaying is dust and dead bugs!! That was it for us. If you cant even clean where people can clearly see what is it we are not seeing. We asked the kids ( 2, 9, 12) If they wanted to stay while they were standing in front of a pool and the 2 older ones said NO! The little one said hotdog. But he was out numbered. So we checked out.

That's how bad it is! As everyone else said the staff was very nice but does that really matter when the place is a gross. And as I was researching this place before we stopped I noticed that the hotel responded to a lot of comments, which I thought was great and maybe they were being kind to people who had high expectations and smoothing it over.

The location is not difficult to find. However, if you are given a second room suite, you have to park behind the hotel as the space in front is reserved for first-floor visitors.

The room also had an individual air-cooling-heating unit.\n\nThe washroom was clean, and the water pressure was sufficient in the basin, but when I hopped into the shower, I was disappointed.

I was surprised that even on a second floor, I was getting such a poor water pressure.\n\nIn morning, I made myself a coffee using the coffeemaker and the coffee was surprisingly dark and had strong flavour.\n\nAnother disappointing aspect of this hotel were the breakfast facilities. For a considerably spacious hotel, they have a tiny breakfast area - maybe 10-12 tables. And it can get pretty crowded in the morning. I asked for a tray so that I could take my breakfast to the room. They said they didn't give away trays as patrons didn't bring them back. Luckily I was able to get a table, but by that time my toast had turned cold. Breakfast consists of basic stuff - nothing fancy but enough to start your morning. The coffee at in the breakfast room was quite disappointing - just hot brown water.\n\nSeems the staff is aware of the limited space and the crowd in the breakfast room but is unable to do anything about this issue. \n\nOverall, for a price I paid, I wasn't very happy with the quality of the hotel and service.",2,negative,"October 3, 2016",1625 Vincent Massey Dr Rr 2,"('Cornwall',)",Ontario,K6H 5R6

I was right beside the stairwell but had no noise issues.  No problems with hot water or water pressure in the shower and a portable blow dryer attached to the wall.\n\nThe breakfast was a bit disappointing.  It is a small room with perhaps 15 tables overlooking the indoor pool area.  The poached eggs looked like the kind that come out of a carton - the whites and yolks didn't taste like real eggs do.  There were also hard boiled eggs, cereal, toast, bagels, individually packaged muffins, oranges, bananas, tea and coffee.  You wouldn't leave hungry and it was better than no breakfast at all.  The two women responsible for the breakfast area were very friendly and helpful. \n\nNot sure if there was an elevator as I didn't see one and carried my luggage up the stairs.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the rear parking lot.  There were a lot of construction folk (from the 401) staying there at the same time along with all their trucks etc.  At midnight when I arrived there were several workers sitting outside drinking. I was unable to park near the rear entrance and had to walk past one large group.  In the morning the area was littered with empty beer cans.\n\nThe check in staff appeared to be a older husband and wife team who weren't too friendly.\n\nOverall it is s decent enough hotel to spend a few hours but if I had paid the full price I would have felt overcharged.

In short, here is the reason behind my visit: I run an organization called Friends With Hearts that sponsors children and families at Christmas. With groups set up across Canada, one of them resides in Cornwall. Once all gifts are purchased, each group hosts a wrapping party where we wrap the gifts for the kids. I thought I should make the trek up to attend. I typically take the month of November off to focus on this initiative, and because every cent that comes in goes back to the family, my bank account takes quite a hit. \n\nI had the idea to reach out to a few area hotels, to see if they would be interested in donating a room for the night to our organization. I went with Comfort Inn.\n\nHow were the beds? Great. How was the service? Very Friendly. The morning breakfast? Quite satisfying. You know, the same thing you\u2019ll read about 90% of the hotels in this city. \n\nSo why read this review? Well, I chose Comfort Inn because out of the seven hotels I contacted, they were the only one to not only offer me a room, but the only one to get back to me at all. They wanted to be a huge part in helping our group give back to those kids in the city. \n\nSo yes, you will find great beds and great service all around this amazing town. But what you\u2019ll find at Comfort Inn, is a staff that shares the values you would want to find in the human beings who are taking care of you on your travels.

Fortunately the guy who was six beers into his evening and out for a smoke had some helpful if colourful advice for how to get it to accept my key card. ;)  Breakfast was fine - about average for comparable hotels with a selection of bread, yogurt, waffles, fruit, etc. Scrambled eggs were just okay.   Location is a short drive into town.

This hotel is a Plus and that may be the reason that it is a higher quality than those that we use to stay in. We had a room that had a electric fireplace.  We didn't pay extra for it and wouldn't if I had to.  It is mostly for the ambiance and doesn't add any heat.  It must be on a timer as it was on when we went to bed but was off later in the night. \n\nWe didn't have any issues with anything.  The room was clean, quiet and reasonably priced.

There was no trolley to put all our stuff on, o viously since there was no elevator.. I asked whether we could get something in the first floor and was told there was nothing available. When we got to our room, there were two queen beds when I had specifically reserved a king bed. I was not very happy. The young lady at the desk did help us carry everything upstairs. She went down to speak to her boss and, lo and behold, there was a king-sized room available and on the first floor! She had to get special permission for us to get that room because it was one of the renovated ones. Well, the room was gorgeous! It was almost a suite with a small seating area, a fireplace and a fridge. We had dinner at the restaurant in the hotel and the meal was excellent!

Being an aficionado of English country and Canadian pioneer decor I was very appreciative of the sumptuous fabrics and tapestry, reclaimed barn wood and beams and gorgeous fixtures and adornments, that defined the visual treat I was presented with as soon as my 14-year old son and I walked into the main lobby. We were seeking a much needed break from house renovations and we couldn't have picked a better place to unwind and rejuvenate. \nUpon arrival, the staff were welcoming, efficient, helpful and friendly.  Onsite facilities include  free access to a fitness room and beautiful wood-paneled pc\u002Finternet room, barn-wood claden halls and sports bar with pool table and games room, two large and relaxing restaurants dining rooms with warm ambience and comfortable seating; one restaurant having an English country feel with heritage-style carpet , wallpaper and wainscoting and  the other with a pioneer Canadian feel with log walls, large bay windows, wall paper and carpet;  and a lovely bar with lots of wood and character, and welcoming wing back chairs centered a round a large double faced brick fireplace.  Both restaurants offer a la carte and buffet, the latter of which we were very happy with in our choice. The roast beef was particularly succulent and the selection of deserts was truly decadent. Large french doors lead off the front part of the restaurant to a terrace on the southwest side of the hotel. For the warmer months, an outdoor swimming pool is also available.  Additionally, a number of conference and banquet rooms make this hotel an obvious candidate as a great wedding venue.  \nOnto our room. For the price, (online $110 CDN) we had a large luxurious room, that qualifies more as a suite given that it had a separate entrance with adjoining bathroom and closet and a main large (approx 12' x 32') room with 2 very comfortable double beds, mini fridge, coffee\u002Ftea facilities, TV with inexpensive blockbuster movie package (3 movies\u002F$11.95) and a lounge area with a loveseat, coffee table and corner fireplace. The bathroom was stunningly beautiful and obviously designed with optimal space efficiency in mind given that the form and functionality of the room belie its 5' x 6.5' size.   As a picture truly is worth a thousand words, take a look at the ones I've posted to see what I mean.\nIncluded with the price of our room was a hearty continental breakfast (nice selection of fresh fruit, bagels, cream cheese, croissants, cereal, muffins, waffles, GREAT coffee), served 6:30 - 9:30 AM.  Alternatively you can forego the continental and apply the cost ($6.95) towards a wonderful brunch buffet (10AM - 2PM), which would otherwise cost $15.95.  The evening buffet is $39.95, a little pricey, but we were not disappointed in the feast. For both the dinner and brunch buffet, a chef was on hand for personal requests (the most popular at brunch being cheese and veggie omlettes and Belgium waffles).  The brunch was the sort of generous Sunday brunch offered by most quality restaurants. \nFinally, the location of this Best Western Parkway Inn hotel makes it a great location for accessing summer tourist attractions, such as Upper Canada village (15-20 minutes away), beaches (ie. Long Sault, ) and camping sites.  An additional bonus is that it's close to great shopping as it sits at the base of the bridge to the US (Masena shopping on the US side) and is close to major Cornwall shopping, (Wal-mart, Home Depot, Winners, Value Village).  \nHope you get a chance to enjoy this wonderful hotel.",5,positive,"May 18, 2009",1515 Vincent Massey Dr,"('Cornwall',)",Ontario,K6H 5R6

I stayed at a hotel on the Friday in Montreal and my husband and I arrived at 12pm, 3 hours before check-in. The ladies at the front desk noticed I was pregnant and called housekeeping to ask them to put a rush on my room....great customer service!  We headed to the Best Western at Cornwall the following day to attend my brother in law's wedding. We had to be ready at the church for 3:30pm. Now I understand that the check-in standard time is 3:00pm but we told the lady at the front desk that we were there for a wedding and would be really appreciative if we could get our room sooner. We were extremely friendly and kind but this lady would not even crack a smile and asked us to return at 1:30pm which we were fine with. We decided to go get lunch and upon our return at 1:30pm we were told that the room would not be ready for another 45 minutes. At this point we began to panic because we were 2 girls that needed time to get ready. The second lady rudely reminded us that check in was not until 3pm, which I understand is true but could it have hurt her to try to call housekeeping and explain our situation? My in-laws also had a room and we had no choice but to use their shower so we could start getting ready which cut into their time getting ready. We received our room key at 2:30pm when my husband had finally had enough and went to the front desk to tell them that they were being completely unreasonable and ridiculous. Sad that that's what it had to take. Around 3pm as we were getting ready the power in our room went out, it took about 15 minutes for someone to get it back up and running. Not that long but was definitely bad timing for us when we didn't have much time left to get ready.

It's an older two storey motel style with gingerbread-decorated gables and chimneys between every pair of rooms, so it looks as if all rooms have remnants of fireplaces as ours did. Hard to say what sort of vines cover the chimneys, since it's late autumn, but they are home to a lot of birds and if the vines are flowering they probably look wonderful in spring and summer.  We had a jacuzzi room, and enjoyed that feature but the switch to turn on the dehumidifier which was mounted near the ceiling was also close to the ceiling, requiring some climbing and ingenuity to reach it. You do want to use that, or the room can get damp.  I appreciated having a window that actually opens, unlike so many hotels today. The room itself was a good size and some might find the rustic chunky pine furniture outdated - however it was in good shape, and very clean, including the carpet.  The big four poster bed was comfortable and removing the canopy would go a long way toward updating the look and making the room feel more spacious. The bathroom was done in tumbled beige tile, again the rustic look and a little dated in style but probably not very old.  The rustic cottage style was finished off by a small shelf on the wall with old hardback books, and this cottage style was echoed in the main floor restaurants. The hotel had a couple of young girls' hockey teams in for the weekend, and their parents were allowing a lot of running up and down halls and yelling, fairly late into the evening. Fortunately, a second door between entryway and actual bedroom helped reduce this noise. The room had a small bar fridge and flat screen tv.  A breakfast buffet was included with our room and included hot and cold choices.  We preferred sitting in the Hops and Barley pub for breakfast because of the long wall of three or four sets of double doors.  Family spent the evening in the lounge area of the pub with big comfy chairs around the fireplace - if anything in the hotel needs immediate attention it would be reupholstering those chairs. THey have good bones, and are quite comfortable, but stained and tired. Aside from breakfast we only ate the \""funeral snacks\"" and pub food, which was tasty enough.  The wait staff were attentive in all three spots - there's also a pub in the basement but I didn't check that out.  There's a Metro grocery right across the street, a Shoppers DrugMart just around the corner, all very handy, but we didn't go looking for restaurants outside of the hotel.

The wine glasses were beautiful - not the inexpensive small glasses you so often find at hotels. The patio was lovely and the gorgeous weather was the icing on the cake.      We later had dinner in the hotel dining room. The menu was very good with plenty to satisfy varying tastes. The food was excellent and was also presented nicely.

data\ca\181722\182039\505512186.html,Best Western Parkway Inn &amp; Conference Centre,"""Stayed one night here, having looked through all our other options within 100km. We needed a place that was more than pure budget hotel, that would accept our dog. \n\nCheck in was quick, but hardly friendly. First you have to find the front reception desk. Then, the person working the desk has to suppress all emotion and charm to check you in as deadpan as they can. Directions to our room were a bit vague -- \""it's the third or fourth door down the parking lot.\"" Is this a major issue? No, but for weary travellers, a bit more enthusiasm (welcome, thank you for choosing our hotel!) and more precise directions to the room would be awesome. \n\nWhen we did find our room (fourth door off the parking lot, for the record) it was sufficient. Queen bed. Small loveseat. Tight clearance to get in (the door does not open all the way due to closet added on -- odd that they would make a hotel room door so tight that it's hard to wheel in a suitcase). Small window looking out over a green strip behind the hotel (nicer than a parking lot!). Lots of lamps, but a dark room (this is a Best Western problem, in my experience). Wallpaper peeling in many places, grotty windowsill and frames... it all adds up to make the room seem a bit grungy. \n\nThe bed was comfortable, the sheets even more so. Noise between rooms was minimal and it's nice that there's an extra door between the room entrance and the hallway to help manage that noise too. The fridge is a larger bar fridge, and the furniture was in fairly good shape. The room was a bit tight overall, for two travellers, their bags, and their dog -- but I've stayed in smaller for sure. \n\nBathroom was small and halfway updated (countertop\u002Fsink). On a cleanliness and comfort scale, it only warranted 6\u002F10 (hairs on wall - eww. Rusty towel rack in the shower\u002Ftub area. Dirty walls\u002Fdoorframe. Tiny cheap hook on back of door.). It did have lots of soap and shower amenities, thankfully. \n\nWe appreciated the welcome kit for the dog -- a bag with treats and doggy clean-up bags, as well as spare sheet and towel. \n\nThe staff in the hotel hallways in the morning were plentiful. Somehow, as we made our way out and back in, it was our duty to move out of their way as they barreled down on us with cleaning carts and such. The halls, like the room entrance-ways, are a bit tight, so it'd be nice to be granted a bit of space. \n\nThe onsite restaurant provided our dinner via room service. It was good enough (though missing part of the meal, as the coleslaw was AWOL from the plates, but listed on the menu) and the person serving it was friendly and fast. Breakfast (included in your stay) in the restaurant is perfectly serviceable -- much better than the usual sad continental on offer in so many places. Hot eggs and fresh fruit always are welcome in my travels. Restaurant staff were great about letting us take food to go, since we couldn't leave the dog in the room unsupervised. I'd say these were the best and brightest staff on site, actually. \n\nWe didn't get to use the pool or fitness centre (it's very small, but at least it's there for your cardio purposes). There is a paved bike\u002Frunning trail across the road that makes it easy to get out for a run, too. \n\nLots of fast food options around the hotel if you don't want to use the restaurant on site. It's mere minutes back to the highway so fairly convenient for travellers. \n\nOverall, nothing too terrible, no real atrocities, just not an inspired property for decor, or service. Feeling well worn, dark and dingy isn't something I'd expect for the BW \""Plus\"" category. At the price point, I'd say it's barely worth what is being charged -- but given the scarcity of other viable options in the area, they get to play with the captive market.",3,negative,"July 25, 2017",1515 Vincent Massey Dr,"('Cornwall',)",Ontario,K6H 5R6

This visit was no exception though we must note that the hotel is beginning to show its age.  It IS an older property, after all, which contributes to its charm: the decor is vintage country lodge, with lots of maple woodwork and homey curtains.  Nevertheless, it needs a serious update to reclaim its high standards.  The rugs are worn, the towels threadbare, and the pillows get smaller every time we stay.  The staff also seems more harried than it used to--possibly because the phone rarely stops ringing in the small check-in office.  The entrance is unwelcoming, with doors difficult to manage and there's far too much signage on the walls.  The restaurant, which is good enough to warrant its own review, attracts locals as well as travellers, leading the tiny lobby to get awfully busy at times--which reminds me, this truly is a conference centre.  In fact, this motel frequently is fully-booked well in advance, so reserve early if you don't want to be disappointed.

Excellent choice. We arrived at 3:30 pm to an informative and prepared front desk staff. The lobby was clean, smelled fresh, and was well lit. The lobby washrooms were immaculate. \nOur room was a double queen. It was spacious and with a decorative outlay that was cozy and functional. I like fireplaces, so I loved the electric one. The small touches like the burgundy bed rolls and the bookshelf added a homey feel. Lots of wood accents and a well stocked bathroom with quality amenities. And a large flat screen TV. Clean remote as well. \nAnd! A fridge to store our cooler foods in. My one suggestion would be possible bottled water in the fridge, or even better, a Brita available to fill up. \nWe had reservations in the lounge, Hops and Barley. It was lovely. We had to wait a little, but our hostess Julie was always checking on us, and our server Arlene was very kind. We had The Burger and the Poulet a La Fabian. Delicious, well plated with good portion size. Make sure you double up on the cushions in your chair! Those chairs are deep and big!! \nWe checked out at 12 noon and we got double reward points!!! \nPlease take the time on your travels to make this a stop for you, whether for pleasure, business, solo or with the family.

Despite the time of year and the weather, the hotel was quite busy. The hotel was well staffed for the number of people there and all the staff I encountered were friendly and accommodating, especially in the restaurant.\nI had a queen deluxe room at the end of the west wing, the most striking aspect of which was a large wood burning fireplace. Alas, no wood was provided to try it out (probably a good thing) but the room did have a faint but not unpleasant, wood smoke smell, The room was large with ample seating and six lamps so visibility was not an issue. The bed was comfortable (no pits), there was a small food prep area with a microwave and bar fridge and ample hot water. Best part of the room was that it was quiet. Even though there were kids running around in the hall, the room had a double door entry which blocked out all but the loudest noise. The AC\u002Fheat unit worked very well and it too was quiet unlike most hotels. The windows in the room were screened and could be opened when the weather is warmer.\nI ate all my meals in the restaurant and both dinner and breakfast selections were ample and reasonably priced.\nThe atmosphere of the property is more lodge-like than hotel as the dominant decor is heavy wood beams and dark colours. The room furnishing were also wood (pine). That along with the fireplaces everywhere made it perfect for a cold fall weekend.\nLots of parking, internet worked fine and there is a fitness room with newer equipment. A separate card is required from the front desk to access the fitness room. This is a bit inconvenient but it ensures only people actually using the equipment have access to it.\nIf you are travelling to our through Cornwall and need hospitable accommodations, I definitely recommend staying here.",4,positive,"November 13, 2017",1515 Vincent Massey Dr,"('Cornwall',)",Ontario,K6H 5R6

Parking is plentiful, but handicap spaces right at the building are a little tight for handicap use. 2 handicap spaces away from the building are a little larger, but were under water on our 2nd visit due to a heavy rainfall, as we arrived in Cornwall.\n\nBoth check ins were efficient, and the young lady taking care of us both times was very pleasant (sorry I didn't get her name), as she is a dedicated employee. \n\nThere is a small outdoor pool, with chairs and loungers, and we were offered large pool towles at check in. We used the pool on our 1st visit, but only sat out during our 2nd. A very pleasant area, almost like a private back yard as there were few poeple using it. \n\nNote there is no eleavator, and the complex is spread out over a large area, so if you have mobility issues please let them know so they can accomodate you. I forgot to let them know for our 2nd night, and they had to rearrange rooms. We ended up with a pet room (102), which we tried to avoid due to allergies but the room was very clean and fresh, however the couch had the odour of wet dog fur,\n\nThe rooms are very spacious, have a wooded Colonial decor, both room # 106 and 102 had electric fire places. Furniture was in good condition, and linens were sparkling white. One nice feature was you have an extra door, shutting the room off from the bathroom and hallway entrance door, creating a vestibule which also muffles any hallway noise. The window opens, but a larger window would brighten the room up\n\nWe ate dinner off property, but had drinks in their very comfortable lounge. We were well taken care of, and the included breakfast was excellant both times. A good selection and different hot choices both times Again the serving staff were very pleasant.\n\nI hope for a return visit in October on my way to Montreal.",5,positive,"August 28, 2018",1515 Vincent Massey Dr,"('Cornwall',)",Ontario,K6H 5R6

The Cornwall Best Western receives a five \""dot\"" rating from me compared to the other choices, and not because it offers luxury.  Having said that, compared to other mid-range hotels anywhere in North America, it compares favourably.\nWe stay once or twice a year.  The staff, front desk, room service, and in the restaurant, are always excellent; everyone is welcoming, helpful, and seems truly to enjoy working there.  \nThe rooms appear to have been renovated since we last stayed.  Our room was very clean and looked \""fresh\"".  Our room attendant was Silvie, and she was excellent; when we returned to our room after the first day, it looked as if it had been made up for new guests.\nWe did not use the exercise room, and it was far to cool to use the pool, so I cannot comment on either.\nSo, why not five stars?  Although the room was pleasant, it was very dark; the room had only one small window which looks onto a barren landscape.  Looking out, one has the sense of being locked in an institution.  And the autumn days that we stayed were cold and wet; we spent much time in the bar\u002Fdining room, looking forlornly at the inoperative fire-places.\nWe will return to visit family some time early in the new year.

Delicious and a healthy choice right?  Sadly it was too popular.  The chef was overwhelmed with 3 orders coming in at once asking for salad instead of home fries and vetoed further substitutions. Keep in mind the restaurant was virtually empty at this time.   No more salads -even at the extra charge . One might ask if this particular substitution is popular enough to overwhelm the kitchen whether if it should perhaps be entrenched as a menu choice?

The bathroom was clean, but again it was outdated. The one good thing I can say was that there was plenty of hot water.

The yogurts were kept cold with plastic ice blocks, and there is no ice in the ice machine. Breakfast is served in the 1970s disco lounge. It was dark and uninviting.

The first night I arrived late in the evening and they did not have my reservation which was made months before, even though I gave them a confirmation number. The room was so hot I had to leave the door to the parking lot wide open and sleep in the nude. I can tell you that it wasn't very dignified,. I complained the following morning and was told that the maintenance people would be contacted and the problem would be resolved. The next night the very same thing happened, extremely hot in the room and had spent another undignified night in the nude with the door wide open. I had stayed at this motel for the previous four years and always brought a group of fisherman who plugged there boats in every evening. We developed electrical problems the second night of our stay. Four boats lost a half a day of fishing as there batteries were not charged. Again our concerns were communicated to the front desk and again we were told that the maintenance people would be called to rectify the situation. The next day the electrical problem worsened as one of the fisherman guest (the electrician) lost power in his room. Early in the morning the front desk was told of the electrical issues, once again the front desk informed us that the maintenance people would take care of the problem.  To Review, After three days the air conditioning or the electrical issues had not been resolved. We arrived back at our hotel at 5pm to once again find that no issues had been resolved and to in fact find the electrical issue had worsened because we now had two rooms without electricity. You can imagine the frustration!!!  In reference to Sam B. General Manager (owner) response... He states that he didn't know \"" not aware you will be charging all sorts of boat batteries\"" yet the staff was familiar with me and the group of fisherman I had brought to the hotel the previous four years all of which charged their batteries every night for a week. Furthermore he states \"" We tried to fix the issue by offering you to plug in your boats at different outlets\"" I can emphatically deny that no solution was ever offered and in fact no issue was ever resolved and no maintenance people ever appeared!!!  The \""incident\"" that the owner refers to was not Rob. H. but Barry P. whose room had no electricity. I believe, he asked you on the phone\"" to come down and fix the problem immediately and explain it to him face to face, coward.\"" I believe your response on the telephone was. \"" nobody talks to me like that, I'm calling the police.\"" So to review: We are forced to sleep in temperatures approaching 100 degrees,  can't charge the batteries in our boats and as a result can't fish, lose power in two rooms and can't even turn the Television or lights on, FIND DIRTY UNDERWEAR AND A ROBE IN THE DRESSER, (the front desk responded by saying we made that up) and you don't ever address or fix any of those issues but your response is to call the police because a customer is frustrated!!!  and evict him!!! Oh did I mention that when we all checked out the next morning because of your abusive behaviour we asked for discounts as a sign of goodwill for the nights we stayed and your response was that our room rate ($79.00) was a discount.  A 8 August 2014 response by sam b. states \"" 100% amount is immediately refunded when any guest for any reason, rejects a room\""  I can tell you that after repeated requests to receive a refund\u002Fdiscount 0% was offered. For the record I stand by Barry P. comment, You are a COWARD.\n On a pleasant note,  There was an employee on staff the last night of our stay, I believe her name was Nicky? It was the first time we had seen her as apparently she had a few days off. She apologized for the owners behaviour by saying \"" he went to far\"" Barry P. should not have been evicted and the police should not have been called.

I was coming in with a group that had reserved a number of rooms, and the rate was discounted compared to other neighboring hotels.  So the price was perfect (and with the current exchange rate it was even better!)  On Sunday, 9\u002F7 I called at 5:14pm and got an answering machine.  I called at 5:24pm and still go the answering machine.  I decided to wait till later in the evening.  I called at 8:59pm adn the phone rang for about 2 minutes, then it disconnected.  So I called at 9:02pm and reached the desk clerk and she asked if I would call back about 5 minutes later as she was with a customer.  I called at 9:10pm, answering machine.  I continued till about 9:20pm when I decided to start leaving a message, the clerk answered the phone.  She was by herself, phones ringing off the hook and guests coming in and she still needed a \""pee break\"" (now I've worked in hotels and am sympathetic, but this was a bit much)  We got the reservation taken care of and I was good to go.\n\nI checked in on Friday 9\u002F11 a little after 10pm.  The clerk, who was the same person who took my reservation was very friendly, gave me directions to the room and said I could park right in front of my room!  The front of the building appears somewhat welcoming...but as I pulled around to the back I was a little frightened!  Our room was on the other side around in back, near the kitchen entrance.  I was relieved to see a friends car parked near our room.  It was dark, as the walk way light was out.  We got into our room and it is okay.  Two entrance doors...one leads to the hotel\u002Ffront desk, and the other leads outside.  Both doors use the room key and I found this VERY convenient!  Clean, spacious, fridge (though that could use updating, it looked about 20 years old!)  Power outlets are visible and easily accessible.  Wifi easy to get to and consistent.  TV channel\u002Fcable selections are plenty, with an added bonus of some non-local radio stations!  So we were pleased.  Beds however are really really stiff, and sit very low to the ground.  Bedding seemed recent and more modern, was comfortable and kept us warm.  Our first night was decent and I would give 3 stars.\n\nOur second night started uneventful, and we fell asleep soon after 11pm.  I awoke around 12:30am to the sound of a fire alarm going off in the hotel.  As there did not appear to be any emergency, I walked to the front desk.  I found five other friends there, and a flustered desk clerk (who was the same girl who took my reservation and checked me in the night before!)  And water, lots of water, pouring out of the ceiling behind the front desk.  She was unable to shut the system down, as she didn't know how to handle the situation as it had never happened before!  No one knew if the fire dept would come or not!  I returned to my room to check on my son, who was out like a light.  Numerous times the alarm would shut off, then turn back on again.  The bell was right outside my door!  After guests called the fire department they showed a little before 1am.  The system was shut down, but would not be on all night.  The desk clerk stated that guests had the option to leave the hotel and would not be charged, or they would issue refunds in the morning.  As many of us were traveling with pets and already in for the night (many of us had been asleep!) we chose to stay the night.\n\nThe refund for one nights room and tax was issued at check out...by the same desk clerk again.  She's still in the same clothes from Friday night and Saturday night, and by now she really needs a shower!\n\nHad it not been for the fire alarm, this property would've received 3 stars, maybe 4.  However, training for staff, especially overnight staff is key, and most important in the event of an emergency.  The girl had no clue what to do.  While I did not have any direct issues with her, I witnessed her with other guests and her customer service skills are lacking at times.  Telling guests \""Well there was nothing wrong with your room, so we're only refunding the price of the breakfast because we can't open that this morning.\"" is not appropriate.  While there may have been nothing physical wrong with the room, we pay for a room to SLEEP in, and if we can't sleep, then there is something wrong.\n\nI think with A LOT of TLC this could be a decent little property.

No niceties, no apologies, no good evening at check-in, no good mornings when we checked out. These owners are in desperate need of courses to train them in customer\u002Fmanagement relationship.

So, I had to go back to the reception desk again to find out what was happening, and there was another customer standing there filling out her registration form. I assumed the manager would be out shortly, but no, he had to push my patience to the point of ringing the desk bell rapidly to get his attention. No apologies for keeping me, or the new customer, waiting. Handed me my key card and sauntered back into his hide-away office.

He looked at my husband who is a tall black rasta from Jamaica and said we are full.I then said i reserved a room at 7pm.He then said oh let me see what i can do only to find out he was lieing the place was far from full with only two cars parked outside the rooms. I paid for two days and 100 dollars deposit which was very weird considering i used my husbands visa.I question why the deposit he just said rudly this is what we do policy.Considering its an old hotel\u002F motel i was surprised .We went to the room which was not in the best of shape but not knowning the area and it was late 11pm we decided to tuff it out.I do mean tuff it out.I was so disgusted with the room i could not sleep i just felt intchy all night plus the heater made a loud noise all night not to mention the young boys running up and down the halls.I decided to go get ice maybe i could do this with some alcohol in my system i walked down the hall no ice vending machines empty and loud noises coming from room i was like wth where am i.Came back to the room complaining to my husband telling him i am not staying here two nights i called the front desk asking about the noisy heater he advised me to turn off the heat.Not to mention it was -16 out but had no choice i turned it down until the noise stopped .Room became cold and we only had a sheet on us because i would not dare put that blanket anywhere near me.So ya night from hell the morning could not come fast enough to get the hell out of there.At 8am i called another hotel who agreed to let us check in at 10am instead of 3pm after i told my story. 945 i went to front desk to check out no one at desk again i waited 5mins then Mr hateful step in saying i am going to check. Your room .My husband was still in room when the man arrived to check the room he pointed at door not even words used to tell my husband to get out.Even though we were paid up until 11am.Mr. hateful came back to check me out being rude with another lady telling her to credit me my money and deposit.suggesting that the end tables had cigarette burns when i then said first off no one smoked i havent had a cigarette in 9yrs mind you after walking in that room i needed more than a cigarette to calm my nerves.I then said i took picture when i stepped in room and video when leaving because i kinda figured this place was sketchy.Then mr hateful argued with me along with his sidekick girl telling me the rooms are clean i laughed clean it was not fit for a pig i told him never less a human.I have never in my life and a have travelled all over the world i got better service in a third world country.This Hotel is not worth one star or one dollar and i plan on making a much bigger complaint its disgusting hotel and very very rude people with no class.This is the longest review i have every written in my life.Tonight we are in a very nice hotel with Good service\uD83D\uDE00\n\n",1,negative,"February 18, 2018",1142 Brookdale Ave,"('Cornwall',)",Ontario,K6J 4P4

Inside the kitchen was a bookcase that one could only describe as \""slanted\"". We were also surprised to find a pair of used running shoes in the closet. The lamp on the one nightstand was covered in burnt plastic which is quite dangerous considering the fact that there was no battery in the smoke detector.\n\nThe kitchen section itself had two outlets for 3 appliances plus the crock pot we brought with us. The power outlet on the oven was not functional.This made cooking inconvenient. We opened the cupboards to assess the pots and pans situation and were surprised to find that the one decent sized frying pan in the room was without a handle. This inconvenience was only made worse by the fact that there were no oven mitts provided. The clock on the oven was broken and constantly flashed 12:00 without any way to remedy it, very annoying.

The windows were sealed shut with paint which made getting fresh air into the room impossible. \n\nThe one nice thing the room had going for it was the view of the St. Lawrence river from the balcony. Unfortunately there was a gang of teenagers in the next room who spent a great deal of time outside smoking which made the balcony an unpleasant place to be. \n\nI will not be staying here again and I would suggest that you reconsider if you are thinking about visiting the area and staying in this motel.

A friend (who lived in Cornwall 40 years ago) recommended the\nMonte Carlo due to its riverfront location. That said, there\u2019s no park or anything to really enjoy that location. There are public areas a short car drive away.\n\nThe hotel\u002Fmotel itself is very shabby and run down. Lots of smoking, likely mostly outdoors, however our room smelled like cigarettes and there were tell-tale cigarette burns on some of the surfaces from times past. \n\nGood features: \n- Despite very small, dingy, shabby and run-down room, it was clean. When it comes down to what\u2019s most important to me, cleanliness is tops. \n- It was very hot and muggy out, but the room temperature was comfortable.\n- I appreciated the fridge, which we used. I didn\u2019t open the microwave.\n- Cost was low, only something like $88 for a night.\n- Parking was easy.\n- Quiet area and we didn\u2019t hear the traffic on the fairly major road between the hotel and the river.\n\nCritical comments:\n- So run down, with rusty and cracked fixtures.\n- Smell of cigarettes was unpleasant.\n- Double bed was much less comfortable that in contemporary hotel-motels. It was very squeaky so hard to rest when the bed made noises with each movement. The pillow was really poor; I\u2019m usually not fussy and just use one regular pillow, but this one was so flat that I\u2019d have appreciated a second one to support my neck.\n- No desk, chair, etc. I used the fridge and microwave for my toiletries (there was a grubby, narrow glass shelf in the bath).\n- There was no tub and the shower area was a dark, small cement structure that we didn\u2019t try. I\u2019m small, but wonder how a very tall or heavy person would manage.\n- The main office-reception area is dirty and dusty. Not physically welcoming. There was a small, cheap coffee maker on the desk and I speculated that they offer coffee in the morning. We left around 8:30 AM, however, and the reception was locked, so even if they had coffee, it wasn\u2019t accessible.\n- There was no WiFi information and I didn\u2019t bother to go back to ask at the reception.\n\nSum: This could be a sweet place if it was fully renovated and cleaned up with some thought. Certainly many places in Europe are tiny - yet functional and pleasant. If cost is your bottom line, this could be acceptable for you. I will not be returning as I don\u2019t like being so cramped, uncomfortable, the smell of cigarettes and feeling a bit creeped out because the ambiance is so sketchy.

While I may not trust every review or critique, I do find the overall impression formed by reading multiple reviews to be most accurate.  Based on reviews for Cornwall, I have traditionally stayed at the Best Western in Cornwall which is always nice and clean, and the breakfast is amazing.\n\nThat said, I can see how there may have been problems here at the Ramada before, but things have turned around significantly.  My room at least was very clean, newly renovated, smelled fresh, and everywhere I went in the hotel, I would say the same. There were many claims of a nasty smell in the hotel in previous reviews, I think those people aren't familiar with Cornwall and it's pulp industry.  There is often a faint \""rotten egg\"" odour throughout the town itself, the sulphurous smell due to the paper mills and their production process.\n\nWhen I arrived at the hotel I was quickly checked in, probably the fastest service I have received in Canada.  That impressed me, and my long trip around the building to my room was expected from other reviews so I didn't mind.  The grounds of the hotel are pleasant with lots of trees and grass.  Right next door is an Ontario tourism building to help plan your Ontario adventures.\n\nThe newly renovated rooms are great.  They are stylish, clean, and comfortable.  I had a room overlooking a small grass area and growth of trees, and it was a very quiet and pleasant stay.  They are much better than the rooms at the Best Western which are getting a little tacky in terms of style.  The free Wi-Fi was fast, so no complaints there.  Free parking doesn't hurt but is expected in Cornwall.\n\nUnfortunately I did not get to try their restaurant or complimentary breakfast as I had to leave before it started.  The restaurant is new, but I heard a complaint about it so I passed on having dinner there.  They may need some time to get it going smoothly and maybe they should give some better incentives for people to eat there.  I also didn't get to use the pool or hotub, but both looked nice and clean.  I'll try them all next time when I have a little more time in Cornwall.\n\nDon't know when I will be back, but the Ramada is much better value for the buck than the Best Western up the street.  I paid $115 for the room here at the Ramada, while the Best Western is upwards of $140.  They may have a great breakfast at Best Western, but you pay for it in the room price.

data\ca\181722\188290\219839385.html,Ramada by Wyndham Cornwall,"""We picked Ramada since we tried it last time when we travelled to London. It was nice, quiet, in a good location and the price was okay. It was $95 in the London trip. It was on a Saturday night. This time the price was $150. I thought the price might have been high due to it was a long weekend. But $150 was about 50% more than the London one. So I automatically set a bit high expectation on it. \n\nThe lobby was nicer than the London one, room facilities were newer, especially the bath room. The swimming pool and the gym were just near the lobby and within a few steps from my room. Breakfast was in the restaurant, which had a nice decoration, even though it was small. The room looked good and did not have any odor. \n\nSince I had a bit high expectation, I can easily point out something that I am not very satisfied. First, the blanket was too thick. It was a nice blanket, made with feather I believe. So it kept me very warm, or even very hot. It was about 14 Celsius outside at night. The room temperature was about 22. I put the blanket on, after a few minutes, I felt very hot. I took it off, just used the white sheets that cover the feather blanket, and I felt cold. I was struggling putting it on and off all the night. Apparently I did not have a good sleep. I asked my wife and she felt similar thing, even not that strong. I have been in some other hotels. Usually only good or high-end hotels have feather blankets. So when I lived in a high-end hotel in the past, I usually turn the AC to a bit low temperature, say 19 Celsius, in order to have a good sleeping temperature with the blanket on. Those hotels were usually in really hot places with outside temperature reaching 29 at night. I had to turn the AC on anyway. But this time the outside temperature was just 14, I wanted to be a bit environmental. My suggestion to the hotel is to provide lighter blankets so that customers are able to have comfortable sleep without AC.\n \nThe restaurant was small. On Sunday morning, the restaurant was packed with customers having their breakfast. Some did not find a table and they had to grab some bread and sit on the sofa in the lobby. When I lined up picking up my bread and tea, I had to be very careful turning around since the space between the buffet tables and the customer tables was very narrow. Once I had a plate in a hand and a cup of tea in another hand and wanted to go back to my seat, I had to stand, check behind me if there was somebody there, move a bit, stop and let another person passing by, move a bit and stop again. The restaurant atmosphere is good for a B&B or a small Inn that only has 10 rooms, not for this Ramada with two stories and more than 50 rooms I guess. \n\nIt was noisy at night. When it was mid-night, it was quiet outside, no traffic. But I heard constantly some noise from kind of machines. It sounded like the fan or motor noise from AC or refrigerators. Maybe it was due to the feather blanket issue I mentioned. People just turned on their AC anyway and contributed to the background noise.",2,negative,"August 5, 2014",805 Brookdale Ave,"('Cornwall',)",Ontario,K6J 4P3

The room appeared to be recently renovated with new furnishings.  The bathroom was clean and also updated with nice sized tub\u002Fshower.  The linens on the bed were awful... poor quality sheets that felt scratchy and rough on your skin.  The room had a flatscreen TV but none of the channels are in HD so all shows are grainy and poor quality.\n\nThe worst part about the room is that there is no thermostat to control the temperature of the room... there was a wall-mounted AC\u002Fheater that looked like it was from the 70's with fan speeds and hot or cold settings (see picture).

Before I could get to the door (i.e. 2 seconds), a maintenance guy had already let himself into the room. My wife screamed and he immediately backed out into the hallway. What makes this even more alarming is that we had our \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign displayed on the outside of our door. He knocked again and when I answered he gave me a story that he was told that a light was out in our bathroom; of course, our lights were fine. I reported this to a helpful woman at the front desk and she said that she would talk to him, that there was no such issue reported, and that he shouldn't even have knocked on our door since we had the \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign displayed. Ok. Chalk it up to a mistake. And shame on us for not barring the door that morning.\nUnfortunately, the next day our relatives reported the same issue in their room! AND we observed the same Ramada maintenance guy letting himself into another room in the same manner; a quick knock and he's in two seconds later.  Needless to say we made sure that we never left any valuables in our room when we weren't there.\nWe also had an issue with the night clerk, Philipe (glasses, unkempt beard) who seemed to have a major chip on his shoulder with family visiting with each other in the lobby at 10:30-11:00 pm.

As in any hotel, you have the main room and the bathroom. In the main room there are only a couple of electrical outlets that you can use on a lamp on the desk. There is no mirror over the desk.

No outlet at the mirror and no mirror at the outlet.

Although we're carrying a pretty nice MSR tent and have pretty much everything we could possibly need to survive even in the wild, sometimes campgrounds get a little tiring, so we try to find a good motel, take the bikes in, check to make sure they're all tuned up, sleep better, shower without mosquitoes trying to eat us alive getting back to the tent. But not all motels are equally useful for cyclists. This one had it all : friendliness, cleanliness, at a good price.\n\nThe receptionist (who also seems to be the owner) gave us her largest room at the same cost as the smaller one, which gave us more breathing space inside to recharge our electronics (you wouldn't believe how many USB cables we're carrying) on that third smaller bed. We took it for a second night after checking the weather forecast.\n\nTo top it off, there's a Shopper's Drug Mart, a Tim Horton's, a Wendy's, a Walmart and a bunch of other commerces withing walking distance. Extremely convenient, since our bikes are loaded and unloading them just to get around the area (let alone having to lock two ~1500$ bicycles outside that are our only mean of transportation) is too much of a hassle.

Super 8 was advertising rooms on different web sites at $95, $99, as well as higher rates. I clicked the $99 per night rate and it indicated it was available (next step was asking for booking information). I then took a 45 minute taxi ride to the hotel to be told that there were no rooms available at the lower price but that I could get a higher priced room at a reduced price (when I inquired, I was told one of my association memberships qualifies me for a 10% discount). It was obvious the hotel was not that busy and certainly did not appear near capacity. I have occasionally seen this trick played at hotels who advertise lower prices as well as in recent years in Europe. Whenever I get the chance, I try to prevent hotels from using this trick by getting a quote confirmed before I arrive at the hotel which was not practical this time.

This, however, left us with the unwelcome prospect of looking for a decent hotel at eleven p.m. After a passing by one seedy-looking property still within Quebec, we decided to push on to a more populated area, which was Cornwall, Ontario. It was worth the extra few kilometres. You're always taking a chance when as desperate as we were that late at night, and there were a few choices in Cornwall, but we chose the first one we recognized, the Super 8 at 2694 Brookdale Avenue. A clean, comfy bed was our number one priority, and the Super 8 did not disappoint. Daniel checked us in quickly, and he was very friendly. The room (#106)  was clean and inviting as soon as we stepped in. The king-sized bed was firm and the bedding was a white and clean as any we have ever slept in. We would stay there again in a minute. What a relief to find a place where we could get such a good night's sleep at the last minute when we needed it the most.

Was told that only superior rooms had coffee makers and to come downstairs if I wanted hot water or coffee. Mind them, asked for one twice and they could not be bother to accommodate a client with such a simple request. The spa, even tho it is advertised on their hotel sign and on websites was not open and was told it never had been in function, that was a let down considering it rained all day and was looking forward for a nice hot spa. Asked for an extra towel at the counter and was forced to play 20 questions! I was asked, don't you have enough towels in your room? Have you counted them before asking? Why do you need an extra towel?... I mean what the hell was that all about? Only wanted an extra towel to dry my hair. They do have a microwave downstairs which could frankly be upgraded, took 9 minutes to cook a frozen meal when the original cooking time was of 5 minutes and to top it off, it also could have used a good scrubbing since I could see the previous users meal splattered on the microwave walls. Asked for utensils and was given flimsy plastic knife and fork so if you plan on getting a frozen meal at walmart to eat there as lunch or dinner, the dollar store has much better utensils.

Over the years, we have watched the steady decline in the quality of these accommodations and the overall level of service. Specifically, where my wife is disabled and we reserved accessible accommodations, we have serious concerns about the facilities and the treatment of disabled guests staying at this property. This motel is very conveniently located almost directly off Highway 401 and is certainly a popular choice for travellers looking for an overnight stop travelling from the Maritimes back to Ontario. However, our stay and treatment by management on this occasion was not at all pleasant.\n\nOn June 21, 2016, we booked an accessible room for August 24, directly through the front desk of the hotel (not the central number). This was confirmed by e-mail on June 21, 2016. The reservation confirmation clearly indicated that an accessible room had been reserved and that Room #102 in the motel was the designated room. On August 5, while travelling in our car en route to New Brunswick, we received a call from a female employee at Super 8 Cornwall who told us the handicapped room would not be available for us on the confirmed date since it was being renovated. We were told we were being upgraded to a larger room which also had a king sized bed. Since we were already in transit and since hotels in Cornwall were already fully booked for August, we decided to accept the change in rooms and kept the reservation. \n\nAfter travelling all day from the Maritimes, our arrival at the motel was late (after 11:00 pm Atlantic Time). Upon arrival, we were required to pay in full via credit card while we were checking in. As exhausted travellers, we just wanted a bed to sleep in as soon as possible after arrival. However, the following shortfalls of the reserved accommodations were too difficult to ignore:\n1.\tThe room reeked of an odour that smelled like dirty socks. Even turning on the air conditioning did not rid the room of this unpleasant smell\n2.\tThe king-sized bed took up most of the room and it was difficult to navigate in the room with a wheelchair and a walker. The larger space we were promised did not exist\n3.\tWashroom was extremely tiny. It was impossible to get into with a wheelchair and the walker had to remain at the door of the toilet\n4.\tBathroom sink was plugged and the plug was broken in the bathtub\n5.\tTissue box only had one tissue left and only one shampoo and two small bars of soap were provided for personal care\n6.\tOverall quality of the continental breakfast had deteriorated from other years (fortunately we travelled with our own food supplies)\n\nTo add insult to injury, we discovered during our stay that there were people staying in the handicapped room (#102) and the room was not being renovated. Upon checkout, my wife asked the manager how many handicapped rooms there were in the motel and he stated point blank that the motel did not have any handicapped rooms. When we got to the car, I checked the original reservation on my smart phone where it was noted that a handicapped room was specified. We went back inside and confronted the manager on the issue. The manager tried to tell us that central reservations may have made a mistake in booking a handicapped room for us originally where we had booked directly with his motel staff. Furthermore, the emailed confirmation was sent from his motel. Our discussion did not go well and voices were raised on both sides of the dialogue. We requested a refund and the manager agreed to give our money back. However, as the conversation progressed, in a dramatic flip-flop, the manager accused us of lying about things and we were told that we were travellers who deliberately go around to hotels and pretend that there were deficiencies in our room in order to not have to pay for our stay. We were asked to leave the property immediately or the police would be called.\n\nIn short, the worst part of our experience during this hotel stay was not the deficiencies of the room itself but the disrespectful, dishonest and rude manner with which we were treated by this hotel manager. This gentleman has much to learn in terms of customer relations and my wife and I were very upset as we drove away in our car following this altercation. The disregard and blatant ignorance this gentleman demonstrated with respect to the needs of handicapped customers and his lack of professionalism in dealing with our concerns would be embarrassing to most experienced hotel managers or anyone accustomed to dealing with customer relations.\n\nWe are very saddened that after so many years of staying at this motel during our annual trek to visit family in New Brunswick that we will no longer stay at this Super 8.

The next morning getting ready to check out I went into the closet to grab my boots while stepping in to get my boots and I almost stepped on a used needle.

After informing them the women asked if I would be discreet about the incident and not tell anyone until she talked to a manager. To kill time waiting my boyfriend and I had breakfast.

I made a reservation directly with the actual hotel roughly 3 to 4 weeks prior to my stay. I was told from a friend who had just booked for the event that he was booked in the super 8 and her price was $98. When I booked my room, I commented that I had heard they had a promotional price with Cornwall BMX with a $98 charge. I was on the phone for roughly 15 minutes while the reservation taker looking into this pricing and affiliation with cornwall bmx. After 15 minutes, I was told that they would honour the $98 change and I gave my credit card to book the room.\n\nWhen I arrived at the hotel, approximately 6pm, I had been up since 3am, driving for 7 hrs then racing all day in the heat. My son and I were beyond exhausted and were looking to shower, eat and bed. \nThe front desk lady acknowledged my reservation and when she told me the price being $160 for the night, I had told her I was quoted at $98. She told me I had to call the 1800 number to find out why the price was different. I asked the front desk lady why I had to make any calls, and that I had a reservation book with a specific price. Again, I was told to call a 1800 number. \nI was getting frustrated with the situation and the front desk lady happened to just receive a call from the owner. She discussed the issue and the owner said I could never get the room for $98 as the hotel is fully booked.\nFully booked or not, I had made my reservation nearly a month prior with a firm price set.

We were en route to a funeral the next day, and hadn't booked ahead. The Super 8 Motel had the last room left in town - due to a convention - and they knew it. It was their 'Jacuzzi room', regularly $199 a night. We had been hoping for a $93 regular room. Gina, the staff person on duty, let us have the room for $139, even though other people were arriving to look for that last room. It was a wonderful room. When I thanked the owner\u002Fmanager, Mr. Muslim Khan, the next morning, for this generosity, he said he was proud of Gina, and that he has told his staff never to take advantage of snowstorms or other reasons to get extra money.

We stayed one night, and believe me, that was plenty! On a brochure we saw, it said \""New and Luxurious\"". What a lie! This place has got to be more than 5 years old...I wouldn't call that new. We learned from other travellers that it used to be a mall that didn't do well, and they just transformed it. This place is a dump. Do not believe the pictures they show you; they are very misleading. There are so many problems...where should I start?\nWhen we first walked in, there was only one person on the front desk. (I think this is awful, and made me feel unsafe, because what if there was a problem and she needed help?) The lady was shoving her mouth with muffins, and it took her forever to realize we were there. She was not wearing the Super 8 uniform and looked so unprofessional. She acted like it was a hassle to check us in, like we had invaded her late-night snack. (Did I mention, when we got there, most of the parking lot lights were burnt out?) The front lobby is very small, but it looks pretty nice, actually. There's a nice big TV and some REALLY comfy couches. There is a computer, but you have to pay to use it. \nWhen we got to our room, we were not impressed. There was a weird smell. There were multiple holes in the wall. The radiator looked melted. There was mold and dust in and around the radiator. The beds weren't that comfortable. The pillows were flat, and we barely got any sleep that night. The bed covers were weird, and didn't even cover the whole bed. How cheap! The bathrooms and small and disgusting. There was water already in the shower, and the tap wouldn't stop dripping. You get these pathetic soap bars (the liquid soap dispenser was broken), and you get TWO pathetic things of shampoo. They look like McDonalds ketchup packets. How on earth did they expect our family of four to use that? The toilet barely worked, you had to hold down the flush thing for like 5 seconds in order for it to flush properly. The towels, which should have been white, were a pale yellow. The TV was really nice and worked well! But the remote was broken. The lock on the door was hard to use. The rooms aren't very sound-proof, we could hear everybody outside our room in the hall. \nThe breakfast is pretty bad. There is a selection of two cereals, some no-name Oat O's, and bran. This is bad for kids, they should have Fruit Loops or Rice Krispies, at least. The coffee didn't even taste like coffee. There is tea, but only one kind. I don't know what kind it was because it was just sitting there in a bag, it wasn't even individually wrapped. There are muffins, but only carrott and banana. We had a carrott muffin, but we noticed these thin, hard, black things in it that looked like mice feces. There is orange and apple juice, sitting in containers. The orange juice goes quickly, and never gets replaced. It is very pulpy and disgusting. There is no fruit. They only had white bread, and no peanut butter. Just marmalade and jam. The garbage can was overflowing. Amongst all these bad things...there is a WAFFLE MAKER!!! It is simply amazing and easy to use. So delicious. The day we were there, there was some man running the front desk and the breakfast. He was never available when you needed him.\nAs for the pool, it's pretty gross. Cold water, and small and shallow. There is NO HOT TUB. It is broken, and hidden behind some white board. I looked, and it was going rusty, which means that it has not be replaced in some time. There were no fresh towels. It's pretty gross looking overall. We had to ask the man to open the pool for us, and he acted like it was some big imposition for him to do it. We got out of there as fast as we could. The main office looks really messy, and there are bottles of Raid everywhere. Is there an insect problem or something?\nOverall I was very displeased with this grimy motel.

Perhaps because of the length of my stay. I was a guest for 4 nights in March during an unseasonably cold period. I found the Inn uncomfortably chilly and the owner reluctant to turn up the heat. In fairness, after repeated requests he did increase the heat. However, during my stay I slept with a polar fleece sweater over my pj's all four nights, and my bed had a down duvet.\nThe bedrooms are all on the second floor so you will have to transport your luggage up a fairly long flight of stairs, wasn't a problem for me but could be for some people.\nI made my reservation online for the room with the king bed and on the day of my arrival was given a room with 2 single beds. I was quite dissatisfied and the next day was moved into a room with a queen bed and an attached sitting room, it was a lovely room that I was happy with.\nI was surprised to find that for the duration of my stay my towels did not get refreshed, nor did my garbage get emptied. I have stayed in a lot of B&B's and never run across that before. \nAs in many B&B's there are no TV's in the rooms, it was fine for me but could be a deal breaker for some.\nBring your own hair dryer as there isn't one in every room. \nThe door from my attached sitting room to the hall did not lock, nor did my bathroom doors and I was uncomfortable that someone could have entered my room anytime of the day or night. \nThe mattress on the single bed was extraordinarily comfortable, and the one on the queen bed was fine. The duvets are very luxurious, the sheets and towels lovely. The furnishings are beautiful antiques, and the embroidered drapes throughout the house are works of art. Much of the decor and art in the Inn was not to my taste, for example I found the statues of human bodies with goats heads to be unsettling. \nThere is a dog living in the house, it's fairly quiet but does bark sometimes.\nOne night the owner had 12 loud people over and the noise went on until almost 10pm, I found the noise quite annoying.\nThe Inn is well located and close to some great restaurants.\nI know it might not sound like it but I enjoy staying at B&B's and I have my favourites that I frequent, however I regret to say that this will not be one of them.",3,negative,"March 26, 2015",40 First St W,"('Cornwall',)",Ontario,K6J 1B9

Our greeting was highlighted by a black Scottie dog that was very friendly.  Robert was an excellent host. Room was clean and comfortable.  Sitting areas plentiful and clean. Breakfast was excellent.  And conversation with host was wonderful.   All will enjoy this property. Right downtown and a block from waterfront park and the st Lawrence river.  Cheers.

The entire house is beautiful and comfortable; our room was small but cozy, clean, and comfortable with a modern shower. Breakfast was delicious and inviting, served on fine china in a gorgeous dinning room. Hamish, the resident dog, was a delight, snuggling with me on the sofa in the parlor. Its gardens are inviting, but it was too late in the season to enjoy them. However, we did walk to the nearby park along the St. Lawrence River to stretch our legs after a day-long car ride and take in the restful scenery. It was the perfect respite on our trip.

Checking-in at Chesley's Inn feels more like arriving at a friends place. If your friend lived in one of the most historic hotels in Canada.

The owner cooks excellent breakfasts and takes pride in his meals - we had superb waffles and  frittata during our two-day stay. The hotel has been nicely restored but with modern bathrooms. The rooms and  furnishings reflect the nineteenth century; our room had an excellent classical library. The dog is laid-back and unobtrusive.

Robert is clearly a man of discriminating tastes with an eye for art worldwide.  We stayed in the smallest room which met our needs for an overnight stay and had a restful night in a very comfortable bed with our own room air conditioner.  There is an aristocratic air about the inn, including a music room.  Breakfast of fresh local ingredients served at 8:00 with a well set table of china\u002Fsilver.  Hamish, Robert's scottie, is gentle and loving and lessens the air of formality of the house with a cuddle on one's lap! One wouldn't expect to find an EV charger, but there is one at the auberge (J1772 plug, worked with our Tesla with adapter, ~ 30 miles per hour.) Robert had recommended the local Birchwood Restaurant and Bar to another guest and us and the three of us met there and enjoyed dining together.

data\ca\181722\6363090\906466027.html,Auberge Chesley&#39;s Inn,"""The Inn is truly amazing.  Was a private home and an inn and then a home for \""wayward\"" boys, during which time it was trashed.  The current owner has revived the place in a quirky Victorian glory.  The furniture, fittings and decor are all very nice.   Gardens left and right of the house have a formal-ish design, but are left slightly overgrown, which makes them comfortable and inviting.\nThe proprietor himself was not on scene.  Two young men, an employee and his friend, plus two delightful Scotties, hosted us.  Breakfast was elegantly prepared and served in a formal style dining room.  Coffee was perfect.  Advice on further navigating Ontario in the infrastructure (ie, road construction) era, was most useful.\nBe aware that this is NOT an upscale spa-like  experience, but more a comfy b&b with many casual aspects.  The dogs greet visitors at the back gate. \n Shoes are left in the kitchen.  Unmodernized windows are propped with sticks.  Our bedroom door could be secured only from the inside, and that with a simple hook.  But the room and bathroom were comfortable, if not spacious, and the relaxed atmosphere was infectious, so overall our short time there was delightful.\nThe neighborhood of the Inn has a sketchy feel to it, but then, not much of Cornwall is all that appealing.  We walked in the evening to a restaurant, of which there are only a few (most of the closed on Monday), and the city had kind of a barren feel to it.  But not any sense of danger.  And maybe we just missed the overall charm of the town.  \nBut the Inn has a charm that's worth the visit.  ",5,positive,"July 29, 2023",40 First St W,"('Cornwall',)",Ontario,K6J 1B9

The Inn has been lovingly and meticulously restored in every way.   We enjoyed  being greeted by Hamish, the  little Scottie Dog who was the Master of the House!    Breakfast was always a nice time to meet other folks staying in the remaining two rooms.   The breakfasts showcased fresh and local ingredients.

The Inn is a fine old Georgian building which has been thoughtfully renovated. We stayed in two rooms during our visit and both were appointed with fine old antiques. The beds were comfortable and air conditioning was not required even though each room had an machine. The breakfasts were large and tasty. The costs are very reasonable. The Inn Keeper, Robert, knows the local history \u002F region of Cornwall and could point out places to visit that \""aren't on the map\"" so to speak. We bought some excellent cheese at a local cheese factory thanks to his help. The Inn is located in the historic heart of Cornwall. Unfortunately the city fathers have seen fit to destroy many of the fine old buildings to Cornwall's detriment. The historic village of Williamstown with it's 3 National Historic Sites and yearly Fair is only a short drive from the Inn.",5,positive,"August 20, 2023",40 First St W,"('Cornwall',)",Ontario,K6J 1B9
